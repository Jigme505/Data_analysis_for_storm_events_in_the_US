# Evaluating the Economic Consequences and Casualties of Storm Events in The United States

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. 
Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible 
is a key concern.

In this project, I explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks
characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates
of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

I try to identify the events with most casualties over the period of 1950 to 2011: first the aggregate total for U.S. as a whole 
and then, for all the states with more than 1000 casualties. After that, I identify the events with highest economic damages for 
the same time period for U.S as a whole.
